				<b className="text-lg">I am a passionate software engineer</b> driven by curiosity and a
				desire to solve meaningful problems. My interest in coding started in high school with an
				introductory C++ course, and since then, I've worked on building impactful solutions while
				constantly exploring and learning new technologies.

			<p className="mb-5">
				I've had the opportunity to contribute to a range of companies from an established industry
				leader to a fast-paced startup to a big tech company. These experiences have given me a
				strong foundation in developing and maintaining software across different environments and
				team structures.

				Outside of academics, I enjoy staying active through lifting, basketball, and climbing. I
				love cooking and experimenting with new recipes, and Iâ€™m always up for exploring different
				cuisines or sharing a good meal with friends. Staying active and spending time with others
				keeps me grounded and motivated both in and out of work.
